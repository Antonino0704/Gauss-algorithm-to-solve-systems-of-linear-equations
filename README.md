# Gauss algorithm to solve systems of linear equations
A program that solves systems of linear equations with Gauss algorithm

The program works when the problem is well-posed

# Installation
```
cd ./test
gcc .\main.c -L../lib/ -lgauss
```

To include it in other projects, you need to use the [gauss.h](https://github.com/Antonino0704/Gauss-algorithm-to-solve-systems-of-linear-equations/blob/main/source/gauss.h) header file and the [libgauss.a](https://github.com/Antonino0704/Gauss-algorithm-to-solve-systems-of-linear-equations/blob/main/lib/libgauss.a) library
