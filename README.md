# Gauss-algorithm-to-solve-systems-of-linear-equations
A program that solves systems of linear equations with Gauss algorithm

The program works when the problem is well-posed

# Installation
```
cd ./test
gcc .\main.c -L../lib/ -lgauss
```

To include it in other projects, you need to use the gauss.h header file and the libgauss.a library
